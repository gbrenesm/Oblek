# Oblek technical test

This repo is for my technical test to enter Oblek Agency as a Full-stack web developer.

I have to make three components with different functions and use the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) for the component 2 and 3.

I use **React** as framework and **Sass** for the styles.
